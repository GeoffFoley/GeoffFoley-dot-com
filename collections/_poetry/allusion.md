Flashes of scenery in reverse  
Float past the underlying reality  
Obscuring the truth below  
With words strewn backwards  
And each consciousness in its own  
Silo of silence without a word said  
As texts are read and monologues prepared  
Carried along under another's power  
For a time that is just  
An allusion to an illusion
