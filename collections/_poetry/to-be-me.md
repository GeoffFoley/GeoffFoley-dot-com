I like my little spot on the curb  
Out in the back  
Of the back parking lot  
I can see in all directions  
I can be an observer, free to watch  
Life literally passing me by  
Not have to wade in the streams  
Of the bullshit and sludge of  
Everyone's every day life  
Just watch, observe, contemplate  
My own mortality and passing life  
This is what it's like to be me  
For fifteen minutes  
On an overcast day in March
