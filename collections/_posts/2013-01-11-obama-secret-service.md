title:  "Obama Signs Law Giving Himself Lifetime Secret Service Protection"

At a time when the nation is reeling from the violence in Newtown, and calls for tighter gun control, the President has reversed a law signed under President Clinton that ended Secret Service protection for presidents and their families ten years after they left office.

Interesting that the law he just signed only applies to presidents elected after January 1st, 1997. That means that George W. Bush will have lifetime protection, but Bill Clinton is shit out of luck.
